For example, if youâ€™re a small business, you may want to start by allocating a portion of someoneâ€™s job toward these efforts, while spreading out other IDEA responsibilities across other roles. As you grow your organization, adapt and carve out space for an IDEA function with a dotted line to your c-suite. If youâ€™re a mid- to large-sized company, begin by resourcing an IDEA team to start building and tackling a long-term strategy and roadmap via company-wide initiatives, analytics, projects and policy changes. Benchmark yourself across other like-minded and similar-sized companies within your industry.",

Unfortunately, it only takes one negative experience around IDEA to tarnish peopleâ€™s trust in their leadership teams and company. Educate and prepare your HR and leadership teams to exhibit inclusive behaviors. Also, if youâ€™re a leader, remember that it takes a lot of courage and energy for people from underrepresented backgrounds to bring IDEA issues to the forefront. So, when they do, create an environment where leaders believe their team members, and work to educate or exit people not aligned with your companyâ€™s mission, IDEA goals and values.",

      "seventh_div_para_sixth": "Whatâ€™s our why? At Greenhouse, we activate the conditions for a diverse, agile and healthy community to win and thrive. We understand that as a hiring software company with thousands of customers and millions of users worldwide, we have a unique opportunity to continue establishing our leadership in IDEA best practices across a variety of industries. While many companies heightened their focus on IDEA during the pandemic and increased racial and social injustice, IDEA has been embedded in our work since our inception, and weâ€™re committed to this being a long-term, ongoing effort.We know there is still plenty of work ahead of us when it comes to our IDEA commitments at Greenhouse. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re taking the time to create our second multi-year roadmap and strategy to encompass the breadth of our shared IDEA work. Weâ€™ve also launched our first-ever internal self-identification program, starting with our EMEA employees and then moving on to our North American employees in the latter half of the year to help us support these goals.We expect the changes weâ€™ve made to our workforce diversity goals and to our approach to positively impact Greenhouse and the professional landscape as a whole through our targeted recruitment, retention, development and thought leadership efforts.The future of IDEA work at Greenhouse is limitless, and weâ€™re looking forward to continuing to share our wins and learnings along the way with you, our Greenhouse community.",
